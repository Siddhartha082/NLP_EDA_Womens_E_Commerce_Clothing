***Context***

Welcome. This is a Women’s Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers. Its nine supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple dimensions.

- **Clothing ID**: Integer Categorical variable that refers to the specific piece 
being reviewed.
- **Age**: Positive Integer variable of the reviewers age.
- **Title**: String variable for the title of the review.
- **Review** Text: String variable for the review body.

## Objectives

**Problem Framing**
* Find Exploratory Data Analysis from the dataset

**Ideal Outcome**
* A success metric is that sentences could find insight for analysis.
* Success means text data excellent for making analysis. 
* Failure means text data used for sentiment predicted is no better than current heuristics.

**Heuristics**
* Consider the text data already for analysis. Assume that data used to exploratory graph and ext.

**Formulation of the problem**

* Text classification : count words in a sentence
* Tokenizes (breaks down words )
        
        I have no read the novel 
        'i', 'have', 'no', 'read', 'the', 'novel'
* Removes punctuation and non-word text 
        
        “!;’#
* Finds word stems 
        
        “chocolates”, “chocolatey”
* Rejoins meaningful stem words         
* Removes stop words 

        “the, a, …”
* Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral.
* SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
* Exploratory Data Analysis for Natural Language Processing
